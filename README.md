Developer, musician, occasionally other things.

## Developer

I'm a software developer currently working at [Reaktor Lisbon](https://www.reaktor.com/lisbon/). My screen nickname is **cyco130**, an example of how things you thought were cool when you were seventeen can follow you around for the rest of your life. Consider it a bad tattoo :D

I'm currently focusing on web programming, mostly using TypeScript. My most important current open-source projects are:

- ðŸ’ƒ [Rakkas](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkasjs): a cutting-edge React metaframework based on Vite
- ðŸŽ© [HatTip](https://github.com/hattipjs/hattip): HTTP server framework for all JavaScript runtimes
- âš¡ [Vavite](https://github.com/cyco130/vavite): a set of tools for developing and building server-side applications with Vite

### Retrocomputing

I'm a retrocomputing aficionado and a huge Atari 8-bit and 6502 fan. My street cred comes from:

- Contributed [Atari 8-bit graphics drivers](https://github.com/cc65/cc65/tree/master/libsrc/atari/tgi) to CC65 TGI library (2009)
- Created [AspeQt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aspeqt/), a cross-platform Atari 8-bit peripheral emulator (2009). Actively maintained fork: [RespeQt](https://github.com/RespeQt/RespeQt)

I'm still working on, from time to time:

- [Sfotty Pie](https://github.com/cyco130/sfotty-pie), a set of 6502 tools. Currently just a command-line emulator. A cross-assembler is also in the works.

### Other dev stuff

I also love compilers and parsers, operating system development, and music-related DSP.

## Music

I'm a semi-retired rock musician with 25+ years on stage. I mainly play guitar and sing.

- I gigged continuously since 2004 with several pub bands in Istanbul. MAT (alternative rock, 2004-2010), [Scop](https://www.facebook.com/ScopBand) (classic rock, 2016-pandemic) and [S-Team](https://www.instagram.com/bildiginizadamlar) (alternative rock, 2010-2023) are the ones I had the most fun with. I'm hoping to find a suitable band in Lisbon too.
- I released two albums with [MAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51N4MjFDOd8) in 2007 and 2010.
- I released a single with [KaÃ§ak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgGDR36ZJ74) in 2019.
- I made commercial jingles for a few years. My most famous one was for [Turkish Airlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnLjlU4rCuc) in 2009 (I'm the singer and co-writer).
- I home-produced several singles and albums for friends over the years.
- I have a (neglected) [SoundCloud account](https://soundcloud.com/cyco130) where I post occasional covers and originals ranging from classical to jazz to heavy metal, and from cringe to listenable.

## Other stuff

- I moved to Lisbon in April 2023. I mostly lived in Istanbul before that.
- I went to Galatasaray High School, a renowned public boarding school in Istanbul.
- I studied International Relations at Galatasaray University (but never graduated).
- I'm fluent in Turkish, English, and French. I worked as a technical/legal translator between the three for a few years.
- Linguistics is one of my hobbies. Yes, I have weird hobbies.
- I can drink 20+ pint glasses of beer in a night, but I rarely do now.
- I drink tea instead. In pint glasses. All day, every day.
- I'm a recovering chain smoker. Five years and counting.
